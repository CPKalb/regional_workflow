Steps for running the SRW app workflow to add 30h GEFS forecast derived perturbations to an RRFS-like ensemble

1*. Generate the 10-member ensemble workflow with HRRR ICs, which is the "RRFS analog"
    - use config.sh_IC_perts
    - can be run through make_ics but stop before run_fcst

1. Generate workflow 9 more times with GFS ICs, otherwise leave the same as HRRR IC run from 1*
    - use config.sh_IC_perts_GEFS
    - run *only* get_extrn_ics to start

2*. pull gefs 30h forecasts (or whatever forecast length we decide one) from AWS or HPSS
    -use get_gefs_rrfs.sh to pull data and cat the "a" and "b" files 
    -NEED TO CHECK THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE - potential duplicate grib2 entries can cause a problem?

2. use cp_gefs_ics.sh to replace the GFS IC files with staged GEFS 30h forecasts
    -then, run all 9 workflows through make_ics

3. Calculate the gefs IC perturbations with calc_perts.sh
    -applies to gfs_data, gfs_bndy (f000), and sfc_data

4. Use add_soil_layers.sh (runs soil_regrid.py) to interpolate the 4 layer NOAH LSM (GFS) soil variables in sfc_data to 9 levels as in RUC LSM (HRRR)

5. use apply_perts.sh to add the perturbations to the HRRR_ICs
    -NEED TO REPLACE THIS - combine with python script which checks for negative moisture values

6. continue running the "RRFS analog" ensemble workflow
    make sure no members are failing!

Namelist notes:
input.nml_BaselineE_chunhua - namelist taken from the RRFS retros from GSL
input.nml_BaselineE_IC_pert_no_merra2 - namelist that works with the HRRR ICs and the rest of our workflow code
    -merra2 options are turned off: iccn and iaer
    -find merra2 fix files and try turning those options back on?
